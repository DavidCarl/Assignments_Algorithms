# Assignment 1 - Sorting Shakespeareâ€™s complete works

This is the first assignment for the Data structure and Algorithms course.
It reads Shakespeare's completed works as a text file, then sorts the file.

## Features

- Read any textfile (as the above into an array or ArrayList)
  - All words should be lower case
  - No punktuations - strip commas, full stops, etc.
- Sort the array using different sorting algorithms:
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge sort  
- Be extended with other sorting algorithms in the future. 

## How to run

1. Open the project in an IDE that can run Java
2. Change file path in FileManager.java to your path to the dataset
3. Run the main file

**OBS:** It take approximately # hours to run this program on the full dataset.
We advise you use `shakespear_s.txt` text file as it only takes a couple of minutes 
to run.
