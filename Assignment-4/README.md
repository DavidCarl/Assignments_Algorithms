Within your groups, implement a directed search.Graph for flight routes using source data from the Airline Network Data directory.
Your graph representation should be such that it is both efficient in terms of memory use and time taken when you complete the following operations on the graph:
1. Find if an airport can be reached from another using only a single airline company. You should compare
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
2. Finding shortest path (in distance) from one location to another (Dijkstra’s algirithm)
3. Finding shortest path (in time) from one location to another, assuming that each leg transfer takes one hour.
4. Finding airline that has widest coverage (MinimumSpanningTree)

- Defend your choice of data structure, regarding time and memory com-
plexity – you know.... O(?).
- Also argue why you did not choose the other data structures possible.
Were they too slow, too large – or both?
- Estimate the size (in bytes) of the array that would be required to complete task #1 above, if you were to use an adjacency matrix.
